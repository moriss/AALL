Position centre without using flexbox

Using transform translate

.center {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

Notes: So the parent element needs to be position:relative; and may need a set height.

top: 50% and left: 50% position the elementâ€™s top-left corner at the center.
transform: translate(-50%, -50%) adjusts the element to be fully centered by moving it back by 50% of its width and height.

NB: This still needs testing btw.
