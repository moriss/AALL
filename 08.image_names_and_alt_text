Once images are selected, sized and optimised:
Write out current image names on a sheet roughly displayed as they are on the website.
Under current image name, write the new image name underneath it AND the alt tag description of the image. 

Now change all your images to the new name and add the alt tags. 

Now change all the image names in your html and css(for background images)
