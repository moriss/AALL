Once images are selected, sized and optimised:
Write out current image names on a sheet roughly displayed as they are on the website. 1 page per web page. Try to note the file it is in (EG:style.css or stylem.css or index.html) Underline images that are background images written in the css. 


Under current image name, write the new image name underneath it AND the alt tag description of the image. 

Now change all your images to the new name. 

Now change all the image names in your html and css(for background images) and add the alt tags

To quickly find the name of a (non background) image, right click, save as. This will show the name of the image.
