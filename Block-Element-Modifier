BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) Naming:
Source: chat>CSS List Spacing>keyphrase: Use BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) Naming:




BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) is a widely-used CSS naming convention that keeps your class names clear and related.
The parent <div> can be treated as the block, and the <ul> (and other elements inside it) can be treated as elements of that block. The way they are linked is via the double underscore '__'


<div class="menu">
  <ul class="menu__list">
    <li class="menu__item">Item 1</li>
    <li class="menu__item">Item 2</li>
  </ul>
</div>

css
.menu /**You don't need to prefix a div **/
ul.menu__list /**But here, You can tell immediately what selector it is.**/
li.menu__list-item  /**And here!**/

And for targeting list elements via psuedo:
li.menu__list-item:first-child {font-weight:bold;}

Pay special attention to the double underscore that signifies you are using the BEM naming convention. 


Chat suggests that using the element name (ul.menu__list) instead of just .menu__list, avoids uneccessary specifity. However, I find it much easier to locate a div if it is so named in the css.
