This is the new repo as you navigate static to wordpress via the course you are on.
This has started off as the go-to place for code snippets which are mostly boiler plate and usefull code reference for common tasks within the static site.

I am currently working through the wordpress course static site at Desktop/All_wp_0624 and copying other sites (Desktop/anysite and elephant) using what I am learning through this and chat.

Bear in mind, any php work needs to be taken to the htdocs file.
