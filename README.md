# AALL

###
AT: 7th October 24
You are populating the AALL repo with extremely useful quick guides to putting your web pages together on a static site. This should be the current go-to when putting a site together. 

With above in mind, you are copying the 'anysite' website to improve you mind muscle in getting sites up and running efficiently and in good time. 

From Before:
gtcoding is currently the ultimate guide to wordpress templates. You will work on this after you are happy throwing together the static sites.
To speed through the first part of this course, go to the php_wp repo.

###
This is the new repo as you navigate static to wordpress via the course you are on.
This has started off as the go-to place for code snippets which are mostly boiler plate and usefull code reference for common tasks within the static site.

I am currently working through the wordpress course static site at Desktop/All_wp_0624 and copying other sites (Desktop/anysite and elephant) using what I am learning through this and chat.

Bear in mind, any php work needs to be taken to the htdocs file. You are not doing php quite yet. You need to put some basic sites together first. Even creating php headers and footers etc require htdocs.
