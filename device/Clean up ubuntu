chat=Ubuntu Memory Cleanup

This checks your available disk space
df -h

Start with this to remove unecessary package files
sudo apt-get clean



Gets rid of packages no longer required
sudo apt-get autoremove




Check for large files using ncdu
You first need to install it if you don't have it
sudo apt install ncdu

Then run it
sudo ncdu /

It may take a while for ncdu to explore and remove large files.

Type ? to bring up the keyboard shortcuts for various tasks.

You didn't take any action with ncdu at this time.





Clear system logs
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
This worked quite well and cleared nearly 1 GB. Be sure you spell it as 2 u's and a capitla M at the end.


Remove temporary files
sudo rm -rf /tmp/*



NOW IT'S TIME TO UPDATE/UPGRADE

This updates the package list but doesn't update/upgrade anything at this point
sudo apt-get update



THis uprades packages but NOT the ubuntu distrobution
sudo apt-get upgrade



THis uprades packages but AND the ubuntu distrobution
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade



Q;s for chat
what does apt stand for
what is ncdu
