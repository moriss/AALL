float for images



<div class="text-with-image">
    <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Description" class="float-right" />
    <p>
        This is your main text content. It will start aligned at the top with the image on the right, then wrap around the image, and eventually return to a full-width flow once itâ€™s past the bottom of the image.
    </p>
</div>

.float-right {
    float: right;
    margin: 0 0 1em 1em; /* Adds space around the image */
    max-width: 40%; /* Adjust width as needed */
}





When you float and image left or right etc to allow text to flow around it, you need to subsequently clear the floating behaviour for element below the image. 

You can do this in two ways (You can also use a pseudo rule but for now, below seems easier. 

This only targets lists with images in them.
ul:has(img) {
    overflow: hidden;
}

or

.text-with-image {
    display: flow-root;
}
