Lists

When creating a simple ul or ol list, use margins to separate the list elements. 

If doing it with flexbox, use gap (but simple lists don't usually require flexbox)

Avoid line height as it can cause confusion. Only use line height for the gap between text lines. So it can be used in a paragraph list element.
