Margin Collapsing
When vertical margins of adjacent block elements collapse into a single margin, it can cause spacing issues, making elements appear closer than expected or overlap.

Solution:
Use padding instead of margins on one or both elements.
Add a border (even if transparent) to separate margins.
Use a layout technique like Flexbox or Grid, which prevents margin collapsing.

Also: setting a 100vh to the main div above also causes a margin collapse. One solution is to change it from vh to height:auto;
