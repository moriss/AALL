SPACE BETWEEN ITEMS
It's best to use the gap property for creating space between list items.

EG: 
ul {gap:1rem;}
Notice how the rule is in the parent tag rather than the list tag itself. (Similar to how flex operates)


SELECTING A SPECIFIC LIST ITEM FOR SPECIFIC STYLING.

<li class="red"> KWA </li>


Using nth child
.main-menu-right ul li:nth-child(2) {color:red;}



Use span if you want to style part of the content in a list item

Directly targeting with a class:


<li>Item <span class="red">2</span></li>
