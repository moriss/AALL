NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR NAVS

START OF SNAP EXAMPLE#####
THis is a snap example of the nav class layout with psuedo elements
.aside ul {line-height:1.3;} /*or 130% for vertical line height*/


.aside a:link {color: red; /* Fallback if rgba not supported*/color:rgba(255,0,0,1); 
transition:color 0.3s ease 0.2s; background-color 0.3s ease 0.2s;}
/* This transition allows a smoother change in color when the pointer hovers over a link. 
This shows for both text colour and background colour. Both are optional.
The 0.3s refers to the time the effect lasts and the 0.2 refers to the delay before the effect begins.*/

.aside a:hover {color:rgba(255,0,0,0.3);}
.aside a:visited {color:rgba(255,0,0,0.7);}
.aside a:active {text-decoration:underline; }
.aside a:focus {outline: 2px solid rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); }/**For keyboard navigation**/


/* THE HTML 
For screen readers, use aria in the html to tell the user what page they are on:
<li><a href="home.html" aria-current="page">Home</a></li>
So for whatever page you land on, have aria-current="page" on the page's link.
Screen readers can otherwise detect where links take users by reading the anchor text.
ie <a href="about.html"> About </a>. Here, the sr will detect 'About' and read it out loud.
*/
a.current {font-weight:bold; color:white;} /*Sets*/
#####END OF SNAP EXAMPLE#####


/*This is the transition rules in long hand.*/
This is longhand where transition:delay (at the end) is used as a further effect. 
    transition-property: color, background-color;
    transition-duration: 0.3s;
    transition-timing-function: ease;
    transition-delay: 0.2s; /* Delay explicitly set */
    



<nav></nav> if just one group of links
<nav class=""></nav> If more than one.

For the main nav:
<nav class="main-nav>

For social navs
<nav class="social-nav">

for call to action navs (shop, donate etc)
<nav class="cta-links" or action-links or utility links.

right-nav specifies location in the header


OR SEMANTIC SPECIFIC  NAMING
shop-donate
or 
commerce-links
or
support-links

Based on purpose
cta-links
important-links
footer-actions (if they compliment or are related to the footer)

Based on context
pre-footer
footer-links 
secondary-nav




SPACE BETWEEN ITEMS
It's best to use the gap property for creating space between list items.

EG: 
ul {gap:1rem;}
Notice how the rule is in the parent tag rather than the list tag itself. (Similar to how flex operates)


SELECTING A SPECIFIC LIST ITEM FOR SPECIFIC STYLING.

<li class="red"> KWA </li>


Using nth child
.main-menu-right ul li:nth-child(2) {color:red;}



Use span if you want to style part of the content in a list item

Directly targeting with a class:


<li>Item <span class="red">2</span></li>
