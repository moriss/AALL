Xampp will be installed to /opt/lampp


When open, go to manage servers and start mysql and proFTPD
Apache web server is probably already started. If not then start it. 

Now type the following url into browser http://localhost/dashboard/
This should show the Welcome page of xampp

Then url ttp://localhost/phpmyadmin/

After your done, simply stop all and close the xampp box

OPENING/RUNNING XAMPP

xampp is located here: cd /opt/lampp

So in terminal type cd .. THEN AGAIN cd .. to get to the directory containing opt

go to the opt directly then the lampp directory (cd opt  then cd lampp)

When you list the contents of the directory, this is the one to look for:
manager-linux-x64.run

To run xampp, type : sudo ./manager-linux-x64.run

This opens xampp again.

ONce xampp is running, you can go to the wordpress file

Only start Apache for php to work
Start MySQL only if your site uses a database
ProFTPD is an ftp server for transferring files. So you don't need this. If you want to use it to update files to a remote server then it will need to be configured to do so.

installing xampp onto memory stick

download zip version instead of executable. You may need to click on a 'more downloads' link.

click on the different versions to get to the different download options.

You are looking for a portable version and a zip.

if you click on 'more downloads' again, you are shown a download popularity box.

installers are .exe files as opposed to zip folders

zip folders are better than .exe installers. This is because installers use relative path names (whatever that means)

To open xampp --> xampp control.exe
