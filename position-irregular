Positioning an image (or other div) halfway into the div above. This is common for videos.


THis is a simple way to move an image halfway into the div above (common for video positioning)
.video-container {
height: 230px;
position:relative; 
transform: translateY(-50%);}

transform:translate(-50%,0);//for both horizontal and verticle
transform:translateX(-50%); //for the horizontal
transform:translateY(-50%); //for the vertical

So the video container moves up (with the image) half into the div above. 
By setting the height of 230px for the parent div, the transform: translateY(-50%); knows to move the image's div half of 230px up the way. 

translateY is for up and down and translateX is for left and right movements.


Another way to do it is to keep the parent div where it is and only move the image. HOWEVER, IT CREATES PROBLEMS WHEN YOU ADD ANY TEXT BELOW THE IMAGE.THE TEXT STAYS WITH THE CONTAINER SO IS OUT OF POSITION.
.video-container {
height: 230px;  
border:1px solid red; }

.video-container img{ 
height:100%; 
position:relative; transform: translateY(-50%);}

Either way doesn't seem to change the position of elements below this parent div and 'wayword' child.

You can read below but it seems more complicated. Chat advised below but I suggested (give or take) doing above [as a theory]



Older below.

I eventually established with chat that simply doing the following
.video-container {height: 230px;  display:flex; justify-content:flex-start;}

#video{ height:230px; position:relative; transform: translateY(-50%); }

So the video container is the same height as the image 



Below is older and perhaps a bit belt and braces.

You create a wrapper for the image (or div) and give the wrapper a height (probably similar to the height of the image (or what the inner div needs to be). This height value is required so that an absolute positioning of -50% for the image/div can be taken from it. By the way, the wrapper for the image/div will follow the same width as its parent element, given that the wrapper is a block level element. 

The wrapper gets a position:relative; and the image or inner div gets a position:absolute; top: -50%; This takes the image/div halfway into the block div above. 

Finaly, you can use flexbox justify-content: center; on the wrapper to have the image/div sit centrally. 

.image-wrapper {height: 230px; position:relative; border:1px solid green; display:flex; justify-content:center;}
#image_1{ border:3px solid white;height:230px; position:absolute; top:-50%; }

Transform Translate is another method (and perhaps the best method)

transform: translateY(-50%);
Below is the same code as above, using translate

.image-wrapper {height: 230px; position:relative; border:1px solid green; display:flex; justify-content:center;}
#image_1{ border:3px solid white;height:230px; position:absolute; transform: translateY(-50%); }
