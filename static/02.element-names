<div class="wrapper"> Is good for wrapping different sections with a div. Ie, you may have a 'main' section next to a 'blog' section,, so the parent should be called generically 'content-wrapper'. Typically, such a wrapper contains all the other divs of a webpage.
</div>





<header> 
The header is for top level elements such as:
A narrow bar at the very top, .header-top or .header.bar 
A main nav bar, .header-main or .header.nav 
A company logo
Hero section (if it falls within entry level contents).

  <nav></nav> SEE 01.NAVS FOR A LIST OF CONVENTIONAL NAV NAMING OPTIONS

So the items here are likely to be h1 tags, logos, site title, search bar  
 
 
 <hero>
 For the name, tagline, large image and/or other introductory content.
 </hero>
 </header>
Please note, the hero section is not always within the header section. It can also be placed in the main section.





 
 <main>
   Primary content unique to the webpage. (No headers, footers or sidebars(if not part of the primary content.))
