line separators

Using <hr/>
The height of an hr seems to ignore the div below and moves into it. So, setting it to around 5px and using it as a separater is fine. Any higher then you start to get problems.

You need to place the hr right after the full stop of the last word and very probably give the div below some margin-top.

A div can also be used but is best if you are starting afresh in a new block element. 
 <div class="separator">
    <div class="line">
	line
	 </div>  
  </div>
