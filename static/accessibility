aria-label


Key sentence at chat>footer Link Naming Conventions :
'This is an accessibility feature that provides additional context for screen readers...'

<nav aria-label="footer-about-section" class="footer-about-links">

So aria-label is basically for screen readers whilst the class is for css targeting.
