The standard font-weight values in CSS are numeric and typically include: 
100 (Thin), 
200 (Extra Light), 
300 (Light), 
400 (Normal or Regular), 
500 (Medium), 
600 (Semi Bold), 
700 (Bold), 
800 (Extra Bold), and 
900 (Black). The keywords normal and bold are equivalent to 400 and 700, respectively. Not all fonts support every weight, so results may vary depending on the font family youâ€™re using.
