Open the image in gimp 

CONVERT = YES
large for  desktop: 1920px wide
medium for tablem: 1024px wide
mobile 768px wide

'Convert' images (as offered) if using for the web. This will ensure consistent colours across devices. Keep the orignial profile if you want a physicle print version.

and decide on the image size(scaling)



IMAGE SCALING:
large for  desktop: 1920px wide
medium for tablem: 1024px wide
mobile 768px wide

The resizing(scaling) will maintain image quality whilst reducing unnecessary pixel date.

Ignore the resolution settings as these are only for physical printing.

Choices for interpolation should be:
Linear for web. 
Although you should choose Cubic or lohalo for hight quality images.

Crop the image at this stage if you think it's required. 



FOR JPG IMAGES
########
We now need to aim for a lossleless or minimally lossy reduction using gimp's "Export As" feature. 

My Note: use jpeg rather than webp for now because you still need to jpeg backup for older browsers. 


NOw it's time to adjust quality settings to 70-85% to balance clarity and size
Use the 'preview' option as you decide on the best quality level/file size.

The various options when exporting are:
Save Exif data: 
check=NO This is date, time and location for camera so this is not required and increases the file size.

Save XMP Data
Check=NO
Including a metadata format for advanced information eg:licencsing edits. Only use this if the image is part of a managed system requiring this metadata.

Save Thumbnail
Check=No
This saves a  small preview of the image in certain programs. THis is not needed for the web and it slightly increases the file size.


Save Colour profile
Check=No (If colour consistency is not critical)
Ensures colours look consistent across devices. However, most modern displays handle the colour well without embedding the profile. This optino is important for branding, photograpy and printing. 

NB: If the image is for printing or is to be archived, check all the boxes so you retain all the information you can. 




NOW FOR THE ADVANCED SETTINGS:
(You can refer to chat>Image Optimization for Web for a deeper understanding)

Optimize = Yes
Reduces file size without changing quality

Use Arithmetic coding = IF YOU CHOOSE THIS, THE IMAGE MAY NOT APPEAR ON YOUR WEBPAGE. NO (Some older tools or browsers might not support arithmetic coding).

Progressive = Yes

Smooth = 0

Use Restart Markers = Yes

Interval MCU Rows = Leave as default

Subsampling = 4:2:0 chroma quartered is best for web.

DCT Method = Integer

############



FOR PNG IMAGES
############
When exporting:
Interlacing Adam7 = Yes for web

Save background colour = No

Save Gamma =             No (for web)

Save layer offset. =.    No  unless you want to re-open the exported image for further editing.

Save Resolution =       No  (This saves dots per inch information for printing)

Save Creation time =    No unless you need metadata for tracking purposes.


Save Comment =         No Adds a text note in the png file. (Unless you need comments)

Save colour values from transparant pixels
                     = No  Reduces file size. 
Only useful if you need to recover colours in transparant areas later. 

Automatic pixel format 
General web use = 8bpc RGB
Greyscale images = 8bpc grey (to reduce file size)
For higher quality (not for web) = 16bpc.


Compression level = 6, otherwise 0
This determines how much the png is compressed. (affects file size but not quality) 9 is maximum compression which gives a smaller file with slower export.

Exif data =        No  Stores camera metadata

xmp date =         No Saves extra metadata, often used for image rights and descriptions.

iptc data =        No  Stores metadata about copyright, author, location, and captions.Not needed. Saves space.

thumbnail =       No  (reduces file size, modern software generates its own thumbnails).

colour profile = Yes  Embeds a color profile (e.g., sRGB) to ensure color consistency across devices.





 


THE UNSHARP MASK FEATURE IN GIME

filters>enhance>unsharp mask

This is a sharpening tool that enhandces the clarity of an imageby increasing the contrast alons the edges of objects. It doesn't make an image clearer in the traditiona sense but makes details more defined. I've used it before for liz but just kept the default settings. 

Further explanation of it is in chat>Image Optimization for Web






Making a png image's background transparant
gimp
layer > Transparency > Add Alpha Channel (If Add alpha channel is greyed out, it means that it's already got one so just skip this bit. 
Use the fuzzy select tool or Select by colour tool to click on the background you want to remove.

Press delete to delete the background.

You can use the erasure tool to remove any spots that have been missed.

Then 'Select' then 'None' to deselect the selection. Select is on the top menu third from the left.

See chat's 'image optiiimization for Web chat 





For png images:

When exporting, uncheck all options apart from the default:
