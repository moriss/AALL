Lists

When creating a simple ul or ol list, use margins to separate the list elements. 

If doing it with flexbox, use gap (but simple lists don't usually require flexbox)

Avoid line height as it can cause confusion. Only use line height for the gap between text lines. So it can be used in a paragraph list element.

If your require bullet points and they overspill into the left div, this is because the div has no margins or padding which are required to move the bullets back into the correct div. So, margin or padding left.

Alternatively, you can use &bull; or &#8227 to emulate bullet points at the beginning of each list item. But instead of having a list you could just have paragraphs or maybe just line breaks.
