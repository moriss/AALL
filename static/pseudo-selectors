pseudo selectors

.parent-element > h1:first-child {color:red;}
h1 is NOT a div so you need to target the first h1 child like so.

main h1:nth-of-type(2) {color: green;}
This targets the second h1 tag.


or to select the first of a specific element

.parent-element > p:first-of-type {  }

selecting the first element in a list
.footer-address__list li:first-child {}
