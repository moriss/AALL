Width distribution among horizontal divs (flexbox)

THe below example has two divs (main and .contact-form) with a ratio of 2:1. Main takes twice the space as .contact-form.

main {flex:2 1 66.6%; }
.contact-form {flex:1 1 33.3%; }

Values from right to left:
Flex bases allows the starting measurement (as a percentage). 
Flex shrink both set to 1 allows them to shrink proportionately.
Flex grow controls how much each item will grow relative to others. So main will grow twice as much a .contact-form.

It's important to use flex bases with accuracy (ie percentages) since using a flex bases of 2 and 1 respectively will not set the sizes relative to the container as you would expect.
